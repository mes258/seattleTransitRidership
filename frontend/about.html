  <h1> About Seattle Transit Ridership</h1>
  <p>
    Seattle Transit Ridership is a tool for learning how transit routes in Puget Sound are used. Since 2024, Seattle Transit Blog 
    has shared a detailed look into the ridership patterns of various King County Metro, Sound Transit, and Community Transit 
    routes. While the Blog will continue to publish these articles, it cannot cover every route. Seattle Transit
    Ridership will share the detailed data for all routes available. This tool is not affiliated with the City of Seattle nor a transit agency.

    How to Read the Charts
  </h2>
  <p>
    Stops are listed on the left axis; passenger counts along the bottom. For each color-coded time period, the bars represent how 
    many people got on or off the bus at each stop. Centered on zero, the right-hand bar shows boardings as positive passenger count 
    and the left-hand bar shows de-boardings as negative passenger count. The dots represent how people were on the bus when it 
    departed the stop. From this data, we can see where along the route the bus is busiest, where riders are mostly getting on or off, 
    and where most riders are simply passing through.
  <br><br>
    Each plot will have up to 5 values per stop, one per time of day: morning (“AM”; 5am to 9am), midday (“MID”; 9am to 3pm), 
    evening (“PM”, 3pm to 7pm), late evening (“XEV”; 7pm to 10pm), and overnight (“XNT”; 10pm to 5am). Some stops will not have data 
    for all time periods. This can occur when a route only runs during peak hours or if the route uses slightly modified paths based 
    on time of day.
  <br><br>
    The data are split into “inbound” and “outbound” directions. This is a direction value determined by the agency. For most routes, inbound 
    trips travel towards the primary destination (eg: downtown Seattle or UW). In the plots shared for each route, inbound trips travel 
    from top to bottom, while outbound trips travel from bottom to top. 
  <br><br>
    The charts displayed for each route are interactive. Simply hover the cursor over a part of the graph to see the specific value. If the
    lines are too small to read, click and drag over a second of the plot to zoom in. The graphing library, Plotly, offers additional tools
    in the top right corner of each chart.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>
    Which agencies and routes are supported?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Initially, most King County Metro and some Sound Transit routes will be supported. Seattle Transit Ridership can only share the ridership 
    data for routes that use vehicles equiped with Automatic Passenger Counters (APC). We are working to add support for other transit agencies 
    in Puget Sound.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What is a service change?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A service change is the period of time between changes in a transit agency's network. King County Metro typically has three service
    changes per year. Their Spring service change is between March and June, the Summer service change is between June and September,
    and the Fall service change is between September and the following March. The agency may add, remove, or revise routes between
    service changes. Information on Metro's current service change is available <a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/routes-and-service/service-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>
  </p>
  <h3>Why are some plots misssing stops in one direction?</h3>
  <p>
    Some routes are through-routed with others. This means the bus changes routes in the middle of its trip, usually before passing 
    through the main destination. For example, northbound Route 14 trips switch to Route 1 at 12th Ave & Jackson St, meaning these 
    trips run south through downtown as Route 1. In the reverse direction, southbound Route 1 trips switch to Route 14 at 3rd Ave & 
    Cedar St and travel south through downtown as Route 14. As a result, passengers on the bus when the route switches are counted as 
    passengers on the new route. Examples of this practice in King County Metro's network include routes 1/14, 2/13, 5/21, 24+33/124, 
    28/131+132, 45/75, and 65/67.
  </p>
  <h3>How is this data collected?</h3>
  <p>
    Many transit agencies track ridership using Automatic Passenger Counters (APC) in their vehicles. Although there is potential for 
    error with APC data, the large number of trips over the duration of a service change absorbs the impact of one-off errors or missing 
    values.
  </p>
  <h3>Can I use these charts elsewhere?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. The charts can be downloaded as a .png image by clicking the camera icon on the top right of the graph. For commericial uses, please
